     *
     *  Following classes implement Standart Singleton pattern.
     *
     *  Benefits:
     *            - This implementation incapsulates creation of the instance within the class
     *              and holding that instance throughout the application lifespan.
     *
     *  Issues:
     *            - This current implementation has multithreading issues.
     *            - Instances can still be created by: cloning, reflection, sub-classing singleton class.
